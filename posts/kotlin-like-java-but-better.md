Kotlin has quickly risen to populatiry as an alternative language to Java. In 
this blog, we will get a Kotlin crash-course examining some of the design 
between Kotlin and Java, and then add some Kotlin code to an existing Java
Spring Boot microservice.

# Kotlin 101
<!-- TODO ADD IMAGE HERE. Maybe school blackboard with 'kotlin 101' on it or something-->
Kotlin was introduced by JetBrains in 2011 as a new language for the JVM. It
was designed to be fully interoperable with Java, and in several cases, has 
replaced it. In 2019, Google announced that Kotlin was now the offical 
language for Android development. Tools such as Spring Boot and 
[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) allow you to start from scratch with
Kotlin, but you can also seamlessly add Kotlin to an existing Java codebase!

# What Kotlin Does Differently
## Variable Declarationt
There are two keywords to declare a variable: `var` and `val`. `var` is used 
to declare a variable that behaves just as you would expect a normal Java 
variable to act. `val` is used to declare 
## Null Safety
One of the key design decisions that the Kotlin team made was to enforce null
safety at compile-time. All variables must explicitly be declared as either
nullable or non-nullable.
